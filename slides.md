<!--
Welcome everyone! Good morning and thank you for joining us today.

This is a full-day hands-on workshop. We'll go from legal context and background to your hands on a keyboard uploading data to the ERA Dataset Manager.

The goal: by end of day everyone can independently provision RINF data as RDF and validate it.

# ⚖️ Legal Framework

**Three directives drive RINF data provision:**

<v-clicks>

- 📜 **EU 2019/773** — RINF Regulation  
  _Infrastructure managers **must** submit data_

- 🔗 **EU 2016/797** — Interoperability Directive  
  _Data must follow TSI requirements_
  _Compliance can be machine-verified via SHACL_

- 📂 **EU 2019/1024** — Open Data Directive  
  _Infrastructure data must be open and reusable_

</v-clicks>

::right::

<div class="mt-12">
<v-click>

**ERA's mandate:**

- Maintain the ontology, SHACL shapes, SKOS vocabularies
- Validate and publish submitted data
- Provide tooling for submission and querying

</v-click>

<v-click>

> 🗓️ **Deadline: 31 March 2026**  
> All data providers must submit RINF data
> in RDF format (ontology v3.1) for routebook parameters

</v-click>
</div>

<!--
The legal context is important — this is not optional. Infrastructure managers are legally required to provide this data.

The Open Data directive means the data, once submitted, becomes public. This is a feature, not a bug: it enables route compatibility tools, journey planners, and infrastructure research.

ERA's role: they don't just collect data — they maintain the entire technical standard (ontology + SHACL + vocabularies).

</ul>

<!--
This is the key insight: the EU (and ERA) chose RDF not just to be modern, but because each layer solves a real problem.

- IRIs: no more "our station ID is 42, theirs is 42 too but they're different stations"
- RDF: a graph model naturally fits railway networks — stations connect to tracks, tracks connect to signals
- OWL Ontology: the schema accompanies the data. New consumers can understand old data.
- SHACL: instead of writing custom validation code, you declare constraints and any validator can check them.

Real benefit: ERA can download a dataset from any IM and validate it with the same SHACL shapes. No custom parsing per IM.

# 📊 RDF vs XML

| Aspect | **XML** | **RDF** |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Data model | Hierarchical tree 🌲 | Graph — triples 🕸️ |
| Identity | Element nesting | Global URI for every resource |
| Validation | XSD | SHACL |
| Querying | XPath / XQuery | SPARQL |
| Linkability | Difficult (XLink) | Native: URIs link across datasets |
| Merging | Trees don't merge | Trivial: union of triple sets |


<!--
The biggest practical difference: XML IDs are local. When you want to reference data from another IM or another system, you need agreed mapping tables. With RDF, the URI IS the identifier — no mapping needed.

This is exactly what RINF needs: 30+ countries, ~600 infrastructure managers, one shared graph.

# 🔎 What is SPARQL?

**SPARQL** is a query language for RDF — like SQL, but for graphs.

<v-click>

A SPARQL query matches **triple patterns** against your data:

```sparql
PREFIX era: <http://data.europa.eu/949/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?tunnel ?name ?length
WHERE {
    ?tunnel a era:Tunnel ;
            rdfs:label ?name ;
            era:length ?length .
    FILTER(?length > 1000)
}
ORDER BY DESC(?length)
LIMIT 10
```

> Checkout this [fantastic wiki](https://kvistgaard.github.io/sparql/#/page/sparql%20wiki) about SPARQL!

</v-click>

::right::

<div class="mt-6 text-sm space-y-3">

<v-click>

**Key concepts:**

- **Triple pattern** `?tunnel a era:Tunnel`
- **Variable** `?tunnel`, `?name` 
- **PREFIX** — shorthand for long URIs
- **FILTER** — numeric, string, date comparisons
- **OPTIONAL** — left joins (like SQL `LEFT JOIN`)
- **UNION** — combine results from two patterns

</v-click>
<v-click>

**Four query forms:**

| Form | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SELECT` | Return a table of bindings |
| 💡 `CONSTRUCT` | Return a new RDF graph |
| `ASK` | Return true/false |
| `DESCRIBE` | Return triples about a resource |

</v-click>

</div>

<!--
Most participants know SQL. The mental model is very similar — match patterns, filter, project.

The key difference: instead of matching rows in a table, you match triples in a graph. Variables are unbound and can bind to any matching node.

CONSTRUCT is the one to emphasise for this workshop — it's the transformation mechanism.

# 🔍 SPARQL vs REST JSON API

| Aspect | **REST JSON API** | **SPARQL over RDF** |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Querying | One endpoint per resource type | Any query over the full graph |
| Cross-dataset joins | Requires custom code | Native — federated queries across IMs |
| Identifiers | Opaque local IDs, mapping tables needed | Global URIs — universal, no mapping |
| Schema | Lives in documentation | Accompanies the data (ontology) |
| Extensibility | New fields require API versioning | Add triples without restructuring |
| Setup cost | Custom development per endpoint | No development — graph is the endpoint |

<!--
Key message: a REST API is a contract between two systems. SPARQL is a standard interface over any RDF graph — no bespoke development, no custom endpoint per question.

Real example: "give me all tunnels longer than 500m in the Benelux with their max speed" — one SPARQL query across datasets from BE, NL, LU. With REST APIs you'd need three different API calls, three different schemas, and custom code to merge them.

# 🤔 How do we glue the pieces back together?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4">
<div>

**The challenge:**
<v-clicks>

- 🗂️ Siloed data models, historically home grown
- 🔤 Semantic interoperability
- 📍 Multiple coordinate systems
- 🔀 Hierarchical + network structure
- ⏰ Temporal validity
- 🌍 Cross-border IMs

</div>
<div v-click>

> _"If there is not enough autonomy, an organisation will be slow to adapt. But with too much autonomy and not enough cohesion, it will grow silos that pursue their own continuation at the expense of the whole._
>
> _Can you have freedom and keep everything working together at the same time?"_

<div class="mt-4 p-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900 text-gray-800 dark:text-blue-100 rounded text-sm">

**Answers: Topology + Linked Data**

- 🔑 Use **IRIs** as globally unique identifiers
- 🔗 Use **RDF** to structure data
- 📚 Reuse **ontologies** for shared meaning
- And... don't give up!

</div>

</div>
</div>

<!--
This is the core motivation for RDF in RINF.

Societies create traffic rules to allow individual freedom while maintaining safe, efficient cohesion. Track design follows standards to form a coherent network. Data needs the same.

Linked Data as the "traffic rules" of data: every organisation can build their own systems, but IRIs, RDF and shared ontologies create the cohesion that makes cross-border integration possible.

This is exactly why ERA chose RDF — not because it's fashionable, but because it's the standardisation layer that makes 600+ infrastructure managers' data work together.

<!--
You don't need to abandon your existing systems. Your internal DB, GIS, and asset management systems stay as-is.

You add an RDF generation step — a transformation layer — that converts your data to ERA-compliant RDF.

The key insight: validate BEFORE you upload. Local SHACL validation gives you fast feedback. The Dataset Manager also validates, but it's slower to iterate.

The LDES option is for the future: rather than batch uploads, stream changes incrementally.

# 🏢 Organisation (Infrastructure Manager)

# 🔗 Topology: LinearElements

**LinearElements** are the atoms of the network topology — each represents a track segment between two connection points (switches, buffer stops, etc.). They have an origin and an end. They are directed.

```turtle
<_:NE001> a era:LinearElement ;
    era:length 500.0 .     # metres — optional but recommended
```

A geometry is attached with GeoSPARQL **`gsp:hasGeometry`**. Only 1 allowed in current SHACL...

```turtle
<_:NE001> a era:LinearElement ;
    era:length 500.0 ;
    gsp:hasGeometry [          # real-world WGS84 LINESTRING
        a gsp:Geometry ;
        rdfs:label "WGS84"@en ;
        gsp:asWKT "LINESTRING(7.4520 51.5100, 7.4620 51.5148)"
            ^^gsp:wktLiteral
    ] .
```

<!--
LinearElements are the atoms: each represents a track segment between two connection points (switches, buffer stops, etc).

gsp:hasGeometry can only appear ones and should be WGS84, longitude first.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# 🔗 Topology: LinearElements with multiple geometries

But what about schematic coordinates? A schematic visualisation? 

```turtle
<_:NE001> a era:LinearElement ;
    era:length 500.0 ;
    gsp:hasGeometry [          # real-world WGS84 LINESTRING
        a gsp:Geometry ;
        rdfs:label "WGS84"@en ;
        gsp:asWKT "LINESTRING(7.4520 51.5100, 7.4620 51.5148)"
            ^^gsp:wktLiteral
    ] ;
    gsp:hasGeometry [          # separate schematic-diagram geometry
        a gsp:Geometry ;
        rdfs:label "Schematic"@en, "Schematisch"@de ;
        gsp:asWKT "<https://data.example.eu/schematic/0/> LINESTRING(0 0, 500 0)"^^gsp:wktLiteral
    ] .
```

<!--
GeoSPARQL doesn't limit the number of gsp:hasGeometry on a gsp:Feature. 

gsp:hasGeometry can appear multiple times on the same element — e.g. one WGS84 LINESTRING for GIS tools and a separate schematic LINESTRING for diagram rendering.

Everything else — signals, tracks, operational points — positions itself ON the topology using netReference. And there could be an automatic calculation of their coordinates in the different coordinate systems.

# 🔗 Topology: NetRelations

**NetRelations** connect `LinearElements` at their endpoints, defining navigability.

```turtle

    era:elementA <_:NE001> ; era:isOnOriginOfElementA false ;   # end of NE001
    era:elementB <_:NE002> ; era:isOnOriginOfElementB true ;    # start of NE002
    era:navigability <era:concepts/navigabilities/Both> .
```

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4 text-sm">
<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 rounded p-3">

**`isOnOriginOfElement`**
- `true` = connects at the **start** of the element
- `false` = connects at the **end** of the element

</div>
<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 rounded p-3">

**`navigability` values**
- `Both` — bidirectional
- `AB` — only A → B
- `BA` — only B → A
- `None` — physically connected, not traversable

</div>
</div>

<!--
NetRelations connect LinearElements at their endpoints. The isOnOriginOf flags determine which end connects where.

Navigability: Both = bidirectional, AB = only A→B, BA = only B→A, None = not navigable (physically connected but not traversable, e.g., bumper only).

The topology coordinate is the most important. It places the element precisely on the network graph.

NetPointReference = one LinearElement, one offset. The simplest case.


**Topological coordinate — mandatory**

**LRS coordinate — optional**

`offsetFromOrigin` is in **metres** from the origin end of the LinearElement.  
The LRS coordinate is independent — both can coexist on the same NetPointReference.

# 🗺️ GeoSPARQL Geometry

Geometries are placed on the element (and/or its netReference). Can be **computed** from topology + LinearElement LINESTRING, or provided directly.

```turtle
<_:SIG001>
  era:netReference [
    a era:NetPointReference ;
    era:hasTopoCoordinate [

    gsp:asWKT "POINT(10.752 59.914)"^^gsp:wktLiteral ] .
  #                  ^^^lon ^^^lat  ← longitude FIRST!
```

::right::
<v-click>
<div class="mt-4 text-sm">

**⚠️ #1 geometry mistake in RINF submissions:**

`POINT(`**lat lon**`)` instead of `POINT(`**lon lat**`)`

**WKT coordinate order in Europe:**

| Position | Dimension | Range |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **1st ← FIRST** | **Longitude** | 4° – 25° E |
| 2nd | Latitude | 35° – 70° N |

**Memory aid:** In Europe, longitude is the *smaller* number. Even though it is LONG

> `POINT(`**10.75** `59.91)` ← 10.75° E, 59.91° N ✅ (Oslo)
> `POINT(`**59.91** `10.75)` ← latitude first ❌

**⚠️ Your GIS tool likely shows `(lat, lon)` — WKT is the reverse!**

</div>
</v-click>
<!--
The GeoSPARQL geometry is what goes on the map.

The coordinate order issue is one of the most frequent mistakes because:
1. Most people naturally think "latitude, longitude" (GPS, Google Maps)
2. Most GIS tools display coordinates as (lat, lon)
3. WKT standard is (lon, lat) — x-axis first, then y-axis

In Europe: if the first POINT value is > 30, it's almost certainly latitude (which belongs second). Run the SPARQL detection query from the appendix to bulk-check your dataset.

Geometry can be computed automatically from topological coordinates by interpolating along LinearElement LINESTRING geometries using Shapely or equivalent. See the era-wkt-geometry-enrichment skill for this workflow.

# 🛤️ Track & Functional Resources

Tracks are ... (nope.. not going to tumble in that rabbit hole...). The ERA ontology distinguishes between RunningTrack (main line tracks) and Siding (auxiliary tracks):

```turtle
<_:TRK001> a era:RunningTrack ;
    era:inCountry country:DEU ;
    era:infrastructureManager <_:0080_IM> ;
    era:netReference <_:NLR_TRK001> ;

    # Functional resources linked FROM the track:
    era:contactLineSystem <_:CLS001> ;
    era:trainDetectionSystem <_:TDS001> ;
    era:etcs <_:ETCS001> ;
    era:maximumPermittedSpeed 160 .
```

<!--
Functional resources are a different category from infrastructure elements.

Infrastructure elements (OP, Track, Signal, Tunnel ...) all inherit from era:InfrastructureElement and have netReference.

Functional resources (ContactLineSystem, TrainDetectionSystem, ETCS) do NOT inherit from era:InfrastructureElement and do NOT have netReference. They are attached to the track via properties like era:contactLineSystem.

This is one of the most common modelling mistakes: people try to add netReference to a ContactLineSystem. The SHACL shapes will catch this — but it's better to understand the architecture than to rely on error messages.

# 📌 Kilometric Post

`era:KilometricPost` → `NetPointReference`

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4 text-sm">
<div>

Kilometer posts mark physical distance markers placed alongside the track. They carry both a **topological coordinate** (position on the topology) and a **LRS coordinate** (the kilometre value from a specific linear positioning system).

**Key properties:**

| Property | Role |
|---|---|
| `era:hasLRS` | Which LRS this post belongs to |
| `era:kilometer` | Kilometrage value (decimal) |
| `era:netReference` | Position on the topology |

</div>
<div>

```turtle
<_:KP125> a era:KilometricPost ;

</div>
</div>

<!--
Kilometric posts are the physical manifestation of the LRS system on the ground.
They are infrastructure elements in their own right — not just annotation.
era:kilometer holds the decimal value; era:hasLRS points to the LinearPositioningSystem resource.

# 🔗 Primary Location

`era:PrimaryLocation` — TAF/TAP TSI telematics link

<!--
PrimaryLocation is a subclass of InfrastructureElement — it has inCountry, infrastructureManager, netReference.
It is linked FROM the OperationalPoint via era:primaryLocation.
The code pattern must match [A-Z]{2}[0-9]{5} — two uppercase letters followed by exactly 5 digits.
ERA is planning updates to this model as part of the TAF/TAP TSI revision.

# 🌐 Open World Assumption — Never Omit, Always State

```turtle
# Omitting contactLineSystem means:
# "we don't know the electrification status"

# To say "not electrified", you must DECLARE it:

⚠️ **This applies to ALL boolean-like properties in RINF.**  No emergency exit? State it explicitly. No gradient? State it explicitly.
Absence only means the data provider hasn't stated it yet.

</div>
</v-click>

<!--
This is arguably the most important conceptual slide of the day for people coming from XML backgrounds.

Practical consequences:
- Non-electrified tracks MUST have a ContactLineSystem with type /40
- Tracks with no gradient restrictions should have maximumGradient = 0, not omit the property
- Tunnels with no special emergency plan still need a document reference if the SHACL shape requires it

The SHACL shapes catch SOME of these (minCount constraints), but not all. The Open World assumption is a mindset change, not just a validation rule.

# ⏰ Temporal Validity Pattern

_:TRK001_begin a time:Instant ;
    time:inXSDDate "2025-01-01"^^xsd:date .
```

</div>
<div>

**❌ Common mistakes:**

```turtle
# WRONG: era:validFrom does not exist!
_:TRK001 era:validFrom "2025-01-01" .

# WRONG: disjoint classes violation!
_:TRK001 a era:RunningTrack, era:TemporalFeature .

<v-click>
<div class="p-3 bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900 text-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-100 rounded text-sm mt-2">

⚠️ `era:Feature` and `era:TemporalFeature` are declared `owl:disjointWith`.  
Never type a track/OP as both. The validity is always on a **separate** `time:Interval` resource.

</div>
</v-click>

<!--
The temporal model is one of the trickier parts. ERA's model follows OWL-Time.

The chain is: Feature → era:validity → time:Interval → time:hasBeginning → time:Instant → time:inXSDDate.

Common mistakes:
1. Using era:validFrom — this property doesn't exist in the ERA ontology
2. Typing the element itself as era:TemporalFeature — causes OWL disjointness violation
3. Putting a date literal directly on era:validity — must be an Interval resource

Best practice: use a SPARQL UPDATE post-processing step to add validity to all elements that don't have one yet.

<!--
CLS is the most complex functional resource.
Non-electrified is a common trap — you must STILL declare a CLS with type /40.
OCL-only properties cause SHACL violations if present on type /40.
Track-level pantograph properties are on the RunningTrack, not the CLS itself.
Aggregation rule: if a track crosses from one electrification zone to another, either split at the boundary or aggregate conservatively.

Border points are a special subtype of OperationalPoint.

The ReferenceBorderPoint is an ERA-managed resource — do NOT define it locally. Its URI is constructed as:
  http://data.europa.eu/949/referenceBorderPoints/{UOPID}

Alternatively, if the UOPID is not known in advance, a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query can use a SERVICE block to query the ERA endpoint:
  https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/api/sparql
and match by geometry (GeoSPARQL, with a tolerance margin) to find the correct ReferenceBorderPoint URI.

4. Use that URI in your Turtle:

**Language requirement:**

<div>

**What these properties express:**

- `era:OperationalPoint era:hasPart era:Track`  
- `era:SectionOfLine era:hasPart era:Track`  
- `era:Track era:isPartOf era:OperationalPoint`

These **don't need to be set in your Turtle source** — they can be derived from topology overlap using SPARQL UPDATE post-processing.


</div>
<div>

```sparql
# Conceptual post-processing — do NOT write manually:
# (handled by era-topology-relations skill)

CONSTRUCT {
    ?op era:hasPart ?track .
    ?track era:isPartOf ?op .
}
WHERE {
    # track's NLR window overlaps with
    # OP's NLR window on the same LinearElement
    ...
}
```

</div>

</div>

<div class="text-sm">

**Inference patterns:**
1. **Point-in-extent**: a point element (e.g. `KilometricPost`) is within a linear element if its topological offset lies within the linear element's effective window on a shared `LinearElement`
2. **Extent-overlap**: a linear element (e.g. `Track`) is part of an aggregate (e.g. `OperationalPoint`) if their effective windows on a shared `LinearElement` intersect

</div>

<!--
This is one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects.
Providers often try to explicitly state era:hasPart from OP to Track based on their knowledge of the physical layout.
This works in simple cases but breaks when topology is updated — the manual assertions become stale.
The topology-based inference ensures containment is always consistent with the actual network geometry.

# 🔌 `era:connectedTo` — Internal Track Connections

RINF parameter **1.2.4.1 Internal connection**

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-2 text-sm">
<div>

**Ontology definition:**

```turtle
era:connectedTo
    a owl:ObjectProperty,
      owl:SymmetricProperty,
      owl:IrreflexiveProperty ;
    rdfs:domain era:Track ;
    rdfs:range  era:Track .
```

Connects two `era:Track` instances (superclass of `RunningTrack` and `Siding`).  
Because it is **symmetric**, `A era:connectedTo B` implies `B era:connectedTo A`.  
Because it is **irreflexive**, a track cannot be connected to itself.

</div>
<div>

<img src="./assets/connected-to.svg" class="max-h-52 w-full object-contain mb-2" />

```turtle
_trackLine1 era:connectedTo _trackA .
_trackLine1 era:connectedTo _trackB .
_trackLine1 era:connectedTo _trackC .

_trackA era:connectedTo _trackLine2 .
_trackB era:connectedTo _trackLine2 .
```

> `_trackA`, `_trackB`, `_trackC` are **not** connected to each other.  
> The unnamed connection between switch 1 and switch 3 is invisible unless explicitly modelled as a `era:Track`.

</div>
</div>

<!--
era:connectedTo answers the question: "which tracks are reachable from this track without reversing direction?"

The limitation is real: if a train arrives on national line 1 in the opposite direction, it can only reach trackC, not trackA — but the property cannot express that asymmetry.

Best practice: infer connectedTo from topology (NetRelation boundaries) rather than stating it manually.

# ⏳ `era:notYetAvailable`

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-2 text-sm">
<div>

**When to use:**

The property **should** have a value, but the IM hasn't submitted it yet. Use `era:notYetAvailable` pointing to the **property IRI itself** — not a value of the property.

**Rules:**
- Object must be an `owl:ObjectProperty` or `owl:DatatypeProperty` IRI
- SHACL-validated inside `era:InfrastructureElementShape`
- **Mutually exclusive** with providing the actual triple — do not combine both

**Semantics:**
> `era:notYetAvailable` = _"this data exists but hasn't been provided"_ (pending/incomplete)

</div>
<div>

Data example: 

```turtle
# Electrification data pending — not yet submitted by the IM
<https://data.example.eu/tracks/TRK001>
    a era:RunningTrack ;
    era:notYetAvailable era:contactLineSystem .

# ✅ The object is the property IRI itself
# ❌ Do NOT also add:
#    era:contactLineSystem <_:CLS001>
```

Find data that is not yet available:

```sparql
# Query: find tracks missing contactLineSystem
SELECT ?track WHERE {
  ?track a era:RunningTrack ;
         era:notYetAvailable era:contactLineSystem .
}
```

</div>
</div>

<!--
era:notYetAvailable is the "I don't have it yet" marker.
It signals an obligation — the data provider acknowledges the property exists and is required, but hasn't been filled in.
The object is the property IRI (era:contactLineSystem), NOT a value of that property.
SHACL will validate that the IRI is actually an owl:ObjectProperty or owl:DatatypeProperty.
-->

---
layout: default

# 🚫 `era:notApplicable`

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-2 text-sm">
<div>

**When to use:**

The property is **conceptually irrelevant** for this element — not unknown, not pending. Use `era:notApplicable` pointing to the **property IRI itself**.

**Rules:**
- Object must be an `owl:ObjectProperty` or `owl:DatatypeProperty` IRI
- SHACL-validated inside `era:InfrastructureElementShape`
- **Mutually exclusive** with providing the actual triple — do not combine both

**Semantics:**
> `era:notApplicable` = _"this property does not apply here"_ (by design, not by omission)

</div>
<div>

```turtle
# Heritage / conventional line: no ETCS equipment fitted
<https://data.example.eu/tracks/TRK001>
    a era:RunningTrack ;
    era:notApplicable era:etcs .

# ✅ The object is the property IRI itself
# ❌ Do NOT also add:
#    era:etcs <_:ETCS001>
```

```sparql
# Query: find tracks where ETCS is explicitly not applicable
SELECT ?track WHERE {
  ?track a era:RunningTrack ;
         era:notApplicable era:etcs .
}
```

</div>
</div>

<!--
era:notApplicable is the "this doesn't apply here" marker.
Classic use case: a heritage or conventional line that is not equipped with ETCS at all.
The object is era:etcs (the property IRI), NOT an ETCS instance.
Contrast with notYetAvailable: notApplicable says "this will never apply", not "this is pending".

# 🔄 Converting Legacy RINF XML to RDF

If your current RINF data is in the **legacy XML format**, you have two paths to generate ontology v3.1 RDF — without writing SPARQL or Python.

::left::

### Option 1 — Dataset Manager (server-side)

1. Log in to the [**UAT Dataset Manager**](https://rinf.uat.data.test-era.europa.eu/)
2. Upload your legacy `.xml` file
3. The server validates it against the **XSD schema**
4. On success, it is automatically **converted to RDF** (ontology v3.1)
5. Download and review the generated dataset

<v-click>

> ✅ No local tooling required. Good first step to see what ERA generates from your data.

</v-click>

::right::

<div>


<v-click>

### Option 2 — Local converter (RINF-XML2RDF)

ERA provides a standalone Windows executable:

**[RINF-XML2RDF.exe on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/era-europa-eu/public/interoperable-data-programme/era-ontology/era-kg-mappings/-/blob/main/RINF-XML2RDF.exe)**

```
RINF-XML2RDF.exe \
  --in   path/to/rinf-data.xml \
  --out  path/to/output.ttl \
  --graph http://data.europa.eu/949/graph/rinf/0088
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

> 🖥️ Run locally — no upload needed.

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 bg-orange-50 dark:bg-orange-900 text-gray-800 dark:text-orange-100 rounded p-3 text-xs border border-orange-300 dark:border-orange-700">
⚠️ <strong>Limitation:</strong> Both methods are limited to what the <strong>legacy XML schema</strong> contains. Parameters absent from the legacy format — including <strong>micro topology</strong> and other properties added in later ontology versions — will <em>not</em> be included in the output.
</div>

</v-click>

</div>

<!--
Both options produce the same ERA ontology v3.1 RDF — they use the same ERA mapping rules.

Option 1 (Dataset Manager) is the quickest to get started: just upload and inspect. Good for IMs who want to see what their existing data looks like as RDF before committing to a full pipeline build.

Option 2 (local exe) gives full control: run offline, integrate into CI, inspect the output before uploading. Requires Windows (or Wine on Linux/Mac).

In both cases, the output should then be validated with SHACL locally before the final production submission.

```
railML XML  →  [01-prep]        SPARQL Anything  →  one-eyed-graph.ttl
            →  [02-construct]   SPARQL CONSTRUCT  →  era-graph.ttl

</div>

<!--
This is a real working pipeline, not pseudocode.
SPARQL Anything removes the need for any custom XML parser — the railML is queried directly as RDF using the facade-x extension.
CONSTRUCT queries are the heart of the mapping — each infrastructure element type has its own .rq file.
Post-processing handles two things: WKT geometry from topology (Shapely), and hasPart/isPartOf inference.
Local SHACL validation before upload saves a lot of round trips with the ERA portal.

The validation report shows each violation with: the resource URI, the property, the constraint that was violated, and the actual/expected values. This is enough information to fix the issue.

# 📤 Full vs Partial Upload

::left::

### Full Upload 🔄

Replaces your entire dataset.

**When to use:**
- First submission
- Major restructuring
- Version upgrade (v3.0 → v3.1)

<v-click>
<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900 text-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-100 rounded p-2 mt-4 text-sm col-span-2">

⚠️ **Referential integrity**: a partial upload referencing an `era:OperationalPoint` must either include that OP or have it already in the published dataset.

</div>
</v-click>

::right::

### Partial Upload ➕

Merged into existing dataset.

**When to use:**
- Regular updates
- New tracks or OPs added
- Property corrections

**Format:** a ZIP file containing:

<div class="text-xs">

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `INSERT.nt` | Triples to **add** |
| `DELETE.nt` | Triples to **remove** |

</div>

<!--
The partial upload is powerful but requires care around referential integrity.

Example: if you add a new Track that is era:isPartOf an existing OperationalPoint, the OP must already be in the knowledge graph. If you're uploading it for the first time, include the OP in the same upload.

Practical tip: for regular incremental updates, maintain a version control system (Git) for your RDF files. Tag releases against ontology versions.

The 40-character hex ID is assigned by the system when you upload. You need to capture it from the API response or query the documents API afterwards.

Language requirement: at least 2 EU official languages. This usually means English + your national language. Provide them as two documentUrl values on the same Document resource.

# 🔍 What is SHACL?

::left::

**Shapes Constraint Language** — W3C standard for RDF validation

SHACL shapes define what your data **must** look like:

```turtle
# A SHACL shape for OperationalPoint
era:OperationalPointShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass era:OperationalPoint ;

    # uopid is REQUIRED
    sh:property [
        sh:path era:uopid ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string
    ] ;

    # opType must be a SKOS concept
    sh:property [
        sh:path era:opType ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI
    ] .
```

::right::

<div class="mt-4 text-sm">

**Constraint types in ERA SHACL:**

| Constraint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sh:minCount 1` | **REQUIRED** — must have ≥1 value |
| `sh:maxCount 1` | At most one value |
| `sh:datatype xsd:string` | Specific literal type |
| `sh:nodeKind sh:IRI` | Must be a URI (not a literal) |
| `sh:class era:X` | Referenced resource must be typed |
| `sh:pattern "^[A-Z]{2}"` | Regex pattern on value |

**Severity levels:**
- 🔴 `sh:Violation` — must fix before acceptance
- 🟡 `sh:Warning` — should fix, non-blocking

</div>

<!--
SHACL is the mechanism that turns the ontology into machine-verifiable compliance.

Key insight: the ERA SHACL shapes ARE the authoritative specification of what's required. When in doubt about whether something is required, look at the SHACL shapes.

The shapes file is at: era-shacl/ERA-RINF-shapes.ttl in the ERA GitLab repo.

Severity: Violations block acceptance in some contexts but the current ERA Dataset Manager accepts data with Warnings (yellow) but may reject on Violations (red). Check current behaviour with ERA.

| `sh:sourceShape` | Which SHACL shape triggered it |

<hr class="my-3" />

> **Note**: When SPARQLConstraints fail, they become more difficult to analyse because there's no reference to the SPARQLConstraint itself. Only the sh:resultMessage will be of help (when ERA patched the UNBOUND variable bug)


<!--
The validation report is your debugging tool. Always start with:
1. How many violations? (vs warnings, which are lower priority)
2. What's the most common pattern? Often one systematic error causes hundreds of violations.
3. Fix the systematic issues first, then tackle individual cases.

Common pattern: thousands of violations all pointing to the same missing triple type → one SPARQL UPDATE to add them all at once.

# 🔧 Systematic SPARQL UPDATE Fixes

Most errors repeat across thousands of elements — fix them all at once in post-processing:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-xs mt-2">
<div>

<v-click>

**Add a default `era:validity` to all elements missing it:**

```sparql
PREFIX era:  <http://data.europa.eu/949/>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
PREFIX xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

INSERT {
  ?e era:validity [
    a time:Interval ;
    time:hasBeginning [
      a time:Instant ;
      time:inXSDDate "2024-01-01"^^xsd:date ] ] }
WHERE {
  VALUES ?t { era:OperationalPoint era:RunningTrack
              era:SectionOfLine era:Signal }
  ?e a ?t .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?e era:validity [] }
}
```

</v-click>

</div>
<div>

<v-click>

**Add `skos:inScheme` to country references:**

```sparql
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX era:  <http://data.europa.eu/949/>

INSERT {
  ?country skos:inScheme
    <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country>
}
WHERE {
  ?element era:inCountry ?country .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?country skos:inScheme [] }
}
```
</v-click>
<v-click>

**Change datatype `xsd:double` → `xsd:integer` for speeds:**

```sparql
DELETE { ?e era:maximumPermittedSpeed ?old }
INSERT { ?e era:maximumPermittedSpeed ?corrected }
WHERE {
  ?e era:maximumPermittedSpeed ?old .
  FILTER(datatype(?old) = xsd:double)
  BIND(xsd:integer(str(?old)) AS ?corrected)
}
```

</v-click>

</div>
</div>

<!--
These SPARQL UPDATE patterns are powerful. They turn thousands of violations into zero with a single query.

Run these in post-processing AFTER your initial SPARQL CONSTRUCT generation but BEFORE uploading. Build them into your pipeline permanently so every future run benefits automatically.

The country inScheme fix (#3): ERA's SHACL shapes check that country URIs have a skos:inScheme triple. That triple lives in ERA's own triplestore, not your upload. So your standalone validation will complain until you add it locally.

Fix #5: Check SHACL shapes for other properties that also require xsd:integer — the same pattern applies to gauge, platform height, etc.

# 🛠️ SHACL Validation Tools

<v-click>

### Local: PySHACL

```python
from pyshacl import validate
from rdflib import Graph

data = Graph().parse("my-data.ttl")
shapes = Graph().parse("ERA-RINF-shapes.ttl")

conforms, report, text = validate(
    data,
    shacl_graph=shapes,
    inference="none"
)

if not conforms:
    print(text)
```

**Free and open source. Suitable for automation.**  
⚠️ Slower than MapLib (~250s for a small graph)

</v-click>

::right::

<div class="mt-4 text-sm">

<v-click>

### Local: MapLib

```python
import maplib

m = maplib.Mapping()
m.read("my-data.ttl", format='turtle')
m.read("ERA-RINF-shapes.ttl",
             named_graph="urn:shapes", 
             format='turtle')

report = m.validate()
```

**Very fast (~1.5s vs 250s for same data)**  
⚠️ Requires [paid licence](https://payhip.com/b/cOImS) for SHACL validation

### Remote: EU Interoperability Test Bed

🌐 [interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed)

- No local setup required
- Upload dataset + shapes
- Retrieve full validation report
- Good reference implementation

</v-click>

</div>

<!--
For most IMs, PySHACL is the recommended starting point: free, well-documented, and integrates into Python pipelines.

The EU Interoperability Test Bed is excellent for a second opinion — different SHACL engine means different potential edge cases.

IMPORTANT: Apply the shape fixes before running validation. Without them, you will get thousands of spurious warnings about OWL/RDF/SKOS vocabulary URIs that are perfectly valid. These obscure the real issues.

Shape fixes are in the 04-validate/shape-fixes/ directory of the example repository.

# ⚠️ Shape Fixes — Why You Need Them

**Running SHACL without fixes → thousands of spurious warnings:**

<v-clicks>

1. **`InstancesMustHaveTypeShape` fires on vocabulary URIs**  
   `<era:concepts/contact-line-systems/10>` has no `rdf:type` in your data (it's defined in ERA's triplestore)  
   → Fix: `exclude-ontology-uris-from-type-check.sparql`

2. **Deprecated-property checks fire on ERA ontology**  
   When adding ontology into datashape, ERA's own deprecated-property SHACL shapes are validation results
   → Fix: `exclude-ontology-uris-from-deprecated-check.sparql`

3. **GeoSPARQL `sh:sparql` constraints throw errors**  
   `geof:distance`, `geof:within` — most validators don't implement these  
   → Fix: filter out SPARQLConstraints referencing `geof:` functions

</v-clicks>

<v-click>
<div class="p-3 bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900 text-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-100 rounded mt-4 text-sm">

📁 Shape fixes are in `04-validate/shape-fixes/` in the example repository.  
Apply as SPARQL UPDATE against the shapes graph **before** running validation.

</div>
</v-click>

<!--
This is a practical issue that can waste hours if you don't know about it.

The ERA SHACL shapes have some known quirks:
1. They check that every IRI has an rdf:type — but SKOS concepts from ERA's vocabulary are only typed in ERA's own triplestore, not in your upload. So they appear "untyped" to a standalone validator.
2. Deprecated-property shapes sometimes fire incorrectly on ontology properties.
3. GeoSPARQL extension functions (geof:distance etc.) are not standard SPARQL and most SHACL validators can't evaluate them.

The shape fixes are SPARQL UPDATE queries that modify the shapes graph to exclude these false positives.

# 🧪 Hands-on: Validate & Fix

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
<div>

### Exercise 1: Local Validation

1. 📥 Download latest `ERA-RINF-shapes.ttl` from ERA GitLab
2. 🐍 Install pySHACL: `pip install pyshacl`
3. ▶️ Run validation on the example dataset
4. 📋 Count violations vs warnings
5. 🔧 Apply shape fixes and re-run — how many warnings disappear?

</div>
<div>

### Exercise 2: Introduce & Fix Errors

1. ✏️ Make these deliberate mistakes in the dataset:
   - Remove `era:validity` from one track
   - Remove `era:trackRaisedPantographsDistanceAndSpeed` from a track
   - Remove `era:netReference` from an OP
2. ▶️ Re-validate
3. 🔍 Find the violations in the report
4. 🛠️ Fix them and validate again

</div>
</div>

<div class="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 rounded text-sm">

💡 **Bonus:** Compare local validation results in pySHACL and maplib or another validator.
Are there differences? 

</div>

<!--
This hands-on is very effective at building intuition for the validation loop.

The deliberate error exercise is particularly valuable: people need to experience the feedback loop firsthand — introduce error, see report, fix, re-validate.

Common observation: different SHACL validators can produce slightly different results. This is normal — some implement more features (especially sh:sparql constraints). The EU Test Bed is a useful reference.

# 🌐 Creating ERA Topology from GIS Geometry

If you have track **GIS geometry** (LineStrings) but no topology, you can generate it programmatically.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-3 text-sm">
<div>

**Three-phase approach:**

1. **Filter & clip** — bounding box filter, GIS → RDF LINESTRING triples
2. **Detect intersections & split** — T-intersections, X-crossings; splits at switches and junctions
3. **Build ERA topology** — each segment → `era:LinearElement`; endpoint clusters → `era:NetRelation`

| Node degree | Pattern |
|---|---|
| 2 — simple join | 1 relation, `Both` |
| 3 — switch/turnout | 3 relations (all pairs) |
| 4 — diamond crossing | 4 relations (straight-through pairs) |

</div>
<div>

```turtle
<_:netElement_seg_123> a era:LinearElement ;
    era:lengthOfNetLinearElement 247.512 ;
    gsp:hasGeometry [
        a gsp:Geometry ;
        gsp:asWKT "LINESTRING (4.482 50.882, ...)"
                  ^^gsp:wktLiteral
    ] .
```

> ⚠️ Watch out for **Z-coordinates**: crossing tracks on different vertical levels (tunnels, bridges) must **not** be split at apparent XY intersections.

Demo script: `scripts/generate_topology_from_gis.py` in the railML-to-ERA repo.

</div>
</div>

<!--
This is highly relevant for IMs who have GIS data but no RDF topology yet.
The phase 2 split loop needs 1–2 passes to converge.
The Z-coordinate caveat is a common source of spurious splits — bridges over tunnels look like intersections in 2D.
-->

# 🗂️ URI Minting & Format Conversion

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-3 text-sm">
<div>

**URI pattern** (from the guide):

```
https://{domain}/{collection}_{localId}
```

- `collection` = plural noun + underscore: `_tunnels_`, `_signals_`, `_netElements_`
- `localId` = source system ID, stripped of spaces and special chars
- No country codes in collection names
- Blank nodes only in CONSTRUCT intermediates — **not** in submitted data

```turtle
# ✅ correct
<https://data.example.eu/_tunnels_TUN001>
    a era:Tunnel .

# ❌ avoid
_:TUN001 a era:Tunnel .
```

</div>
<div>

**Format conversion** — convert between serializations with Apache Jena `riot`:

```bash
# Turtle → N-Triples (faster upload for large files)
riot --output=NT era-graph.ttl > era-graph.nt

# N-Triples → Turtle (for readability)
riot --output=Turtle era-graph.nt > era-graph.ttl

# Validate syntax only
riot --validate era-graph.ttl
```

Or with Python `rdflib`:

```python
from rdflib import Graph
g = Graph().parse("era-graph.ttl")
g.serialize("era-graph.nt", format="nt")
```

</div>
</div>

<!--
URI minting is one of the most common sources of errors — providers often reuse internal IDs that contain spaces, slashes, or non-ASCII characters.
The riot tool is fast and catches syntax errors before you hit the portal.
ZIP upload is supported for large NT files.

# 🔗 URI Dereferencing

**Make every ERA IRI a clickable, human-readable resource** — using the open-source [`Matdata-eu/simple-dereferencing`](https://github.com/Matdata-eu/simple-dereferencing) tool.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4 text-sm">
<div>

**What it does**

- Client-side SPA served by nginx in Docker
- Runs a SPARQL `DESCRIBE` on any URI → renders HTML
- **Content negotiation**: Turtle, RDF/XML, JSON-LD (via `Accept` header or UI button)
- **Geo**: detects `gsp:hasGeometry` → renders a **Leaflet map** automatically

**Quick start**

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 \
  -e SPARQL_ENDPOINT=https://linked.ec.europa.eu/sparql \
  -e BASE_URI=https://linked.ec.europa.eu/era/id \
  ghcr.io/matdata-eu/uri-dereferencer:latest
```

</div>
<div>

**Example URIs to try**

```
https://data.matdata.eu/_operationalPoints_opp141
```

```
https://dim-dev.review.apps.banenor.no/data/
    _station_3f3f78ee-4ea4-42e2-9dc3-dcf4c3a43e32
```

**Use cases**
- ✅ Check submitted data looks correct before validation
- ✅ Share a URI with a colleague — gets human-readable page
- ✅ Debug geometry: WKT coordinate → Leaflet map pin
- ✅ Inspect RDF in Turtle / JSON-LD without a SPARQL client

</div>
</div>

<!--
URI dereferencing is the "last mile" of Linked Data — it turns an abstract IRI into a page a human can read.
The simple-dereferencing tool is a lightweight nginx container: point it at any SPARQL endpoint and a base URI, and every URI under that base becomes a dereferenceable resource.
Participants running the tool locally can paste any ERA URI into their browser and immediately see the structured data plus a map if geometry is present.
This is also a useful debugging technique: if your submitted data doesn't show up correctly here, there's a problem upstream.

<!--
Data providers often miss ontology changes between submissions because they don't know where to look.

Three complementary views:
1. CHANGELOG.md — quick machine-readable summary per version. Good for scripting or CI checks.
2. Application Guide revision section — human-readable with rationale. Best for understanding the "why".
3. Git diff — shows the exact triple-level changes. Useful for understanding what your pipeline needs to be updated to handle.

Encourage attendees to bookmark all three and check before each submission cycle.

Service Desk = human support. Use for anything that requires ERA action (access, urgent issues).
GitLab = technical issue tracker. Use for bugs and improvements. Public means other IMs can see the issues and learn from them too.
RINF Team = project/policy questions.

The User Manual covers a lot of ground and is worth reading before the first submission.

# 🧪 Hands-on: GitLab Issue Tracker

<div class="mt-4">

1. 🌐 Open: https://gitlab.com/era-europa-eu/public/interoperable-data-programme/era-ontology/era-ontology/-/issues

2. 🔍 Browse the open issues — find one related to:
   - Dataset Manager
   - SHACL validation
   - A specific ERA class you work with

3. 📋 Read a recent issue: does it have enough information? What's missing?

4. 🗣️ Add your voice to the [common characteristics subset issue](https://gitlab.com/era-europa-eu/public/interoperable-data-programme/era-ontology/era-ontology/-/issues/281) or [the lineside distance indication](https://gitlab.com/era-europa-eu/public/interoperable-data-programme/era-ontology/era-ontology/-/issues/252) discussion.

5. ✏️ **Create an issue** based on a bug you encountered today.

</div>

<!--
This exercise builds the habit of using the issue tracker productively.

Reading existing issues is surprisingly educational: you can see what problems other IMs have encountered, and often find answers to your own questions.

The "draft but don't submit" instruction is important — we don't want to flood the tracker with test issues.

# 💬 Open Questions & Discussion

**Topics to explore together:**

<v-clicks>

- 🔮 How will ontology upgrades work in the future?  
  _Who migrates existing submitted data when ERA changes the ontology?_

- 🤝 Community of Practice  
  _How can IMs share tools, pipelines, and best practices?_

- ⚡ Functional resources as InfrastructureElements  
  _Should ContactLineSystem, ETCS, TrainDetectionSystem carry their own netReference?_

- 🔄 LDES vs batch uploads  
  _What would event-driven incremental data provisioning look like for your organisation?_

- 🧩 CommonCharacteristicsSubset  
  _Is it helping or causing more problems than it solves?_

</v-clicks>

<!--
These are discussion topics derived from real open questions in the ERA community.

The ontology upgrade question is particularly practical: if ERA publishes v3.2, does all previously submitted data become invalid? How does ERA communicate the migration path?

Encourage IMs to share their own challenges and questions here.

# 🎯 Key Takeaways

<v-clicks>

1. 📜 **Legal mandate** — RINF RDF v3.1 submission of routebook parameters required by 31 March 2026

2. 🔗 **RDF is the right choice** — graph model fits railway networks naturally; IRIs enable federated data

3. 🏗️ **Architecture first** — topology (LinearElements, NetRelations) is the backbone; everything else positions on it

4. 🔄 **Validate early, validate often** — run SHACL locally before uploading; apply shape fixes first

5. 🌐 **Open World** — never assume absence means false; explicitly state "not electrified", "no restrictions", etc.

6. ⚡ **Functional resources** — ContactLineSystem, ETCS, TrainDetectionSystem have no `netReference` — linked FROM tracks

7. 🆘 **Help is available** — GitLab for technical issues, Service Desk for access, RINF team for questions

</v-clicks>

<!--
Quick mental recap of the most important things from today.

If participants only remember 3 things:
1. The deadline is real — March 31
2. Validate with SHACL before uploading
3. Open World assumption: absence ≠ false

The most important next step after today: take a SMALL piece of your real data and run it through the pipeline.

Don't try to convert everything at once. Start with one operational point and its tracks, validate, iterate.

The example repository on GitHub (raillML-to-ERA) is a real end-to-end pipeline that you can learn from and adapt.

# 📎 Appendix: KG Generation Tools

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm">
<div>

### ✅ Recommended: SPARQL-Anything

```sparql
PREFIX fx: <http://sparql.xyz/facade-x/ns/>
PREFIX xyz: <http://sparql.xyz/facade-x/data/>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?op a era:OperationalPoint ;
      era:opName ?name ;
      era:uopid ?id .
}
WHERE {
  SERVICE <x-sparql-anything:my-data.xml> {
    # Query your XML as if it were RDF
    ?root xyz:stations/xyz:station ?s .
    ?s xyz:name ?name ;
       xyz:id ?id .
    BIND(IRI(CONCAT("...", ?id)) AS ?op)
  }
}
```

💡 **Tip**: Use the one-eyed-graph approach — convert source data to a plain RDF representation first, then query with clean SPARQL CONSTRUCT.

</div>
<div>

### Other Options

**R2RML / YARRRML**
- W3C standard for relational → RDF
- YAML syntax (YARRRML) is human-friendly
- Good tool support: RMLMapper, Morph-KGC
- ⚠️ Complex for nested data

**OTTR Templates**
- Parameterised templates per ERA class
- Good for large-scale consistent mappings
- Smaller community than R2RML

**DIY Python/Java**
```python
from rdflib import Graph, Namespace
ERA = Namespace("http://data.europa.eu/949/")
g = Graph()
g.add((op_uri, RDF.type, ERA.OperationalPoint))
g.serialize("output.ttl")
```
💡 Avoid this if possible — prefer declarative tools

</div>
</div>

<!--
This appendix slide provides a reference for tool selection.

SPARQL-Anything is the recommended approach for most cases because:
1. SPARQL is a skill you need anyway (for querying and debugging)
2. It handles virtually any source format
3. The one-eyed-graph pattern gives clean SPARQL without SPARQL-Anything specifics

The GitHub repository (raillML-to-ERA) provides a complete working example of the SPARQL-Anything pipeline.

DIY Python: only use this as a last resort. It's hard to maintain and easy to get wrong.

# 📎 Appendix: URI Minting Patterns

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm">
<div>

### ERA Namespace

```
http://data.europa.eu/949/{module}/{class}/{id}
```

**Modules:** `topology`, `trackside`, `onboard`, `body`

```
# Examples:
http://data.europa.eu/949/topology/linearElement/NE-001-SVN
http://data.europa.eu/949/functionalInfrastructure/operationalPoints/ATAhH1K
http://data.europa.eu/949/functionalInfrastructure/signals/SIG-4201
```

**ID character restrictions:**  
✅ `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`  
❌ No spaces, `/`, `.`, `(`, `)`, `#`

</div>
<div>

### Own Namespace

```
https://data.yourorg.eu/_className_localId
```

```
# Examples:
https://data.bane-nor.no/_operationalPoints_OP001
https://data.sncf.fr/_tracks_TRK-4201
```

**Requirements:**
- URIs must be **dereferenceable**
- HTTP GET on URI must return a response
- Support content negotiation:
  - `Accept: text/html` → HTML page
  - `Accept: text/turtle` → RDF description

💡 Flat structure easier to manage than nested paths

</div>
</div>

<!--
URI design is a one-time decision that's hard to change later. Both options are valid.

ERA namespace: easy to get started, no infrastructure needed, but you're minting URIs in ERA's namespace — they need to follow ERA's conventions.

Own namespace: requires you to set up a dereferenceable endpoint. An open source tool (URI-Dereferencer on GitHub) makes this easier.

Recommendation: if your organisation plans to publish broader Linked Data, invest in your own namespace with dereferencing. If you just need to submit RINF data, ERA namespace is fine.

# 📎 Appendix: SPARQL Cheat Sheet

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm">
<div>

### Find all OPs in a country

```sparql
PREFIX era: <http://data.europa.eu/949/>
PREFIX country: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/>

SELECT ?op ?name WHERE {
  ?op a era:OperationalPoint ;
      era:opName ?name ;
      era:inCountry country:DEU .
}
LIMIT 10
```

### Check required properties

```sparql
PREFIX sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>
PREFIX era: <http://data.europa.eu/949/>

SELECT ?property WHERE {
  ?shape sh:targetClass era:OperationalPoint ;
         sh:property ?ps .
  ?ps sh:path ?property ;
      sh:minCount 1 .
}
```

</div>
<div>

### Find missing validity

```sparql
PREFIX era: <http://data.europa.eu/949/>

SELECT ?element ?type WHERE {
  VALUES ?type {
    era:OperationalPoint
    era:RunningTrack
    era:SectionOfLine
  }
  ?element a ?type .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?element era:validity ?v .
  }
}
```

### Verify SKOS concept

```sparql
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>

ASK {
  <http://data.europa.eu/949/concepts/op-types/10>
    skos:inScheme
    <http://data.europa.eu/949/concepts/op-types/OpTypes>
}
```

</div>
</div>

<!--
These are the most useful SPARQL queries for data provisioning work.

The "Find missing validity" query is particularly useful as a pre-upload check — run it against your graph before validation.

The "Verify SKOS concept" ASK query is useful when you're unsure if a concept URI is valid.

Point people to the ERA SPARQL endpoint and Yasgui for trying these queries interactively.

<!--
A quick reference card of the patterns that trip people up most:
1. Organisation: use era:Body + era:OrganisationRole (not era:InfrastructureManager)
2. Validity: the full chain — Interval → Instant → date
3. Country: must include skos:inScheme
4. Geometry: POINT(lon lat) — longitude FIRST

Print this as a handout for participants.
